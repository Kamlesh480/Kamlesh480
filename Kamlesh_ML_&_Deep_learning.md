# Machine Learning Topics

- Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks),
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 

# Deep Learning

- Neural networks,
- L2 and dropout regularization, Batch normalization, gradient checking, 
- Mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam,
- Neural network in TensorFlow,
- Convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks,
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and commonly-used variants such as GRUs and LSTMs.
